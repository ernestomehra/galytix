# Instructions:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

Checkout or download the code, then install the Angular CLI, and do:

`npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running end-to-end tests in browser mode.

Navigate to cypress_e2e folder and run the command:

`npx cypress open`

A gui client will open, after that click on `smoke-suite-spec.js` to run the tests.

To avoid opening the client and running all scripts at once in chrome, run command `npx cypress run --browser=chrome`

## Running end-to-end tests in headless mode.

Run command `npx cypress run`
